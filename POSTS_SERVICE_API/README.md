## Overview 
The post creation microservice allows users to put their places up as a listing. This service allows the sublessor to create a posting by providing information about their property such as a brief description about their place along with facilities, number of rooms available to sublet, the price of the listing, the restricitions, the location and duration of the sublet. All this property information is then added to the data source.
